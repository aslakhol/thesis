== Conclusion and contributions

In this work, we apply the methodology presented by Sharma et al. citenp:[sharmaAssessingCognitivePerformance2020] to engineer generalizable features from gaze data.
The work draws on three independent studies with data gathered on a total of 370 subjects.
We also propose an architecture to efficiently and easily test the generalizability of pipelines constructed of different combinations of pipeline components.
The code for our platform and the analysis is available on GitHub citenp:[sollesnesS0lvangIdealpancake2021].

Our contributes include:

- The list of generalizable features presented in xref:generalizable_pipelines[].
- The list of context-sensitive features presented in xref:context_sensitive_pipelines[].
- The architecture and implementation for experimenting on modular pipelines for generalizability experiments presented in xref:implementation[].
